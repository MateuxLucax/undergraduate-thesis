# UDESC - Software Engineering - Undergraduate Thesis

This project is my undergraduate thesis in Software Engineering at UDESC (Santa Catarina State University). The project is about the development of a Flutter linter that helps developers build accessible mobile applications.

## Abstract

This work aims to promote accessibility among developers, raising awareness of the importance
of creating accessible applications to ensure that everyone can enjoy what we build. Based on the
accessibility specifications of major mobile platforms (Android and iOS), a package for Flutter
applications was developed to provide real-time suggestions about potential accessibility issues.
The package was implemented in Dart, Flutter’s programming language, and made available on
the official package repository, pub.dev. It was tested in example applications available in its
official repository, demonstrating compliance with the established accessibility requirements.
Thus, Flutter app developers can integrate this tool into their projects, contributing to the creation
of more inclusive applications.
