 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  This work aims to promote accessibility among developers, raising awareness of the importance of creating accessible applications to ensure that everyone can enjoy what we build. Based on the accessibility specifications of major mobile platforms (Android and iOS), a package for Flutter applications was developed to provide real-time suggestions about potential accessibility issues. The package was implemented in Dart, Flutter’s programming language, and made available on the official package repository, \href{https://pub.dev}{pub.dev}. It was tested in example applications available in its official repository, demonstrating compliance with the established accessibility requirements. Thus, Flutter app developers can integrate this tool into their projects, contributing to the creation of more inclusive applications.
